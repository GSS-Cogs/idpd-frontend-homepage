The\ndata can be filtered by sector, and to see how emissions have changed across\nthe time series.\n\n[Air pollution data](https://naei.beis.gov.uk/reports/reports?report_id=999)\nare also available on a local authority basis which looks at a number of gases\nthat cause air pollution. Carbon dioxide which is presented in the emissions\nreports above is also considered an air pollutant. A number of activities\ncontribute to both air pollutant and carbon dioxide emissions. Other\nactivities that contribute to carbon dioxide emissions do not contribute to\nair pollutant emissions and vice versa.\n\nThis is a National Statistics publication and complies with the code of\npractice for statistics.

From 2020 onwards figures relate to the median time taken by the appropriate response vehicle to respond to an incident. Calculations are based on the time taken to respond to each incident within a one month time period (August). This data refers to CAT1, CAT1(T) and CAT2 emergency responses, excluding Healthcare Professionals (HCP) calls.\nPrior to 2020, figures relate to the median i.e. midpoint value is reported rather than the simple average as it is unaffected by atypically long or short response times. \nThe median response time for response to incidents is calculated over the month of August as a sample of the calendar year. Measured in minutes and seconds. Data supplied by the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS). Data refers to Categories A, B & C emergency responses, excluding Healthcare Professional (HCP) calls. The median (i.e. the midpoint) is reported rather than the simple average as it is unaffected by atypically long or short response times (outliers).\nFurther analysis of this data for most and least deprived areas and also rural comparisons are available from the Department of Health, health inequalities statistics. Sub-regional inequality analysis are also available which includes analysis of inequality gaps within HSC Trust and LGD areas.

When\nemissions are reported by source, emissions are attributed to the sector that\nemits them directly. When emissions are reported by end-user, energy supply\nemissions by source are reallocated in accordance with where the end-use\nactivity occurred. This reallocation of emissions is based on a modelling\nprocess. For example, all the carbon dioxide produced by a power station is\nallocated to the power station when reporting on a source basis. However, when\napplying the end-user method, these emissions are reallocated to the users of\nthis electricity, such as domestic homes or large industrial users.\n\nBEIS does not estimate emissions outside the UK associated with UK\nconsumption, however the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\npublishes estimates of the [UK’s carbon\nfootprint](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint)\nannually. The [alternative approaches to reporting UK greenhouse gas emissions\nreport](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-greenhouse-gas-\nemissions-explanatory-notes) outlines the differences between them.\n\nFor the purposes of reporting, greenhouse gas emissions are allocated into a\nsmall number of broad, high level sectors known as National Communication\nsectors, which are as follows: energy supply, business, transport, public,\nresidential, agriculture, industrial processes, land use land use change and\nforestry (LULUCF), and waste management.\n\nThese high-level sectors are made up of a number of more detailed sectors,\nwhich follow the definitions set out by the [International Panel on Climate\nChange (IPCC)](http://www.ipcc.ch/), and which are used in international\nreporting tables which are submitted to the [United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)](https://unfccc.int/) every year. A\n[list of corresponding Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) used and a record of\nbase year emissions](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-greenhouse-\ngas-emissions-explanatory-notes) are release_date separately.\n\nThis is a National Statistics publication and complies with the Code of\nPractice for Statistics.\n\nPlease check our [frequently asked\nquestions](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-greenhouse-gas-\nemissions-statistics-user-guidance) or email\n[Climatechange.Statistics@beis.gov.uk](mailto:Climatechange.Statistics@beis.gov.uk)\nif you have any questions or comments about the information on this page.\n\n  *[SIC]: Standard Industrial Classification\n  *[LULUCF]: land use land use change and forestry\n  *[IPCC]: International Panel on Climate Change\n  *[UNFCCC]: United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n  *[GWPs]: Global Warming Potentials",

Further information, including how this UK definition compares with the\ninternational definition of woodland, is provided in the Sources chapter.\nStatistics on woodland area are used to inform government policy and resource\nallocation, to provide context to UK forestry and land management issues and are\nreported to international organisations. They are also used in the compilation of\nnatural capital accounts.\nIncreases in woodland area result from the creation of new woodland. This can be\nachieved through new planting or by natural colonisation of trees. Further\ninformation is available https://cdn.forestresearch.gov.uk/2022/09/Ch1_Woodland_2022.pdf",
